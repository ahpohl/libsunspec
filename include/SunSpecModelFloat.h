        Please note, that the inverter serial number is not supported on all devices and also
        depends on the internal inverter controllerâ€˜s production date and its software version.

        If the inverter serial number is not supported, then two fallbacks are implemented that
        are still unique but may not match the inverter serial number printed on the nameplate:

        1: Serial of inverter controller (PMC) if supported
        2: Unique ID (UID) of inverter controller

        For SYMOHYBRID inverters the inverter serial number is not supported and this register
        always contains one of the two implemented fallbacks.

        Please note further that due to startup timing issues or synchronization faults this field
        may change its value during operation from one option to another, e.g. at boot time only UID
        is available and after some time device information is synchronized then this field changes
        from UID to PMC or inverter serial number.
